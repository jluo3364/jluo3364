# üåª Hi there! I‚Äôm Jessica, an aspiring data/ML engineer.
- Junior at Rutgers University, studying computer science
- Passionate about transforming large volumes of raw data into actionable insights üåü 
- Currently learning advanced ML techniques through [Break Through Tech AI](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/) and exploring front-end development with React
- Former Data Engineer Intern at Johnson & Johnson‚Äîdeveloped tools to support exploratory data analysis (EDA) of clinical study results
- Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with baking recipes. Banana bread is my favorite to bake! üçû

## üéØ Featured Project: Topic Modeling for Clorox
**What We Did**: Developed topic modeling modules to extract key themes from online customer reviews. Created improved alternatives to an existing solution that produced excessive topics (100-300) for each product subcategory.

**Tools**: Python, Gensim (LDA2Vec), scikit-learn (LSA), Top2Vec, BERTopic, Groq (to use Llama3), HuggingFace sentence-transformers

**Result**: Models generate 10-20 representative topics per product subcategory, enabling marketing and R&D teams to focus on critical customer feedback. Reduced topic modeling costs by using Llama3 instead of OpenAI.
